# Community and Open Source Reading List

A living list of materials that might be valuable for anyone who is working in, around, or with _community_, _community building_, _open source_, or _developers_. I've found these useful and/or inspiring over the course of my tenure as Community Manager at [Basho](http://basho.com). Perhaps you will, too. 

This is not exhaustive and I plan to add to it as I come across new pieces or remember past ones of significance. **Pull requests are encouraged.**

Enjoy.
